- 👋 Hi, I’m Jim Holway on behalf of @VermontElders
- 👀 Empowering older Vermonters through education & advocacy.
- 🌱 
As a grassroots organization, COVE looks to Vermonters who support our work at the State House and in the lives of the older people you love and care for. 

COVE seeks members to help support the cost of our work and volunteers to assist in our office or in the field as Legislative Monitors or Educators. If you are interested in learning more about becoming a volunteer, contact Ruby at: RubyB@vermontelders.org or call our office at (802) 229-4731.
